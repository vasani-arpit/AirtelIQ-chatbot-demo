# Airtel IQ Chatbot demo

Whatsapp based e-commerce with accessibility using Airtel IQ.

## Problem 
Obiviously whatsapp has large users but there is large amount of whatsapp users who are illiterate or doesn't know how to use keyboard. I am talking about people who know how to use whatsapp but they haven't ever opened browser in their smart phone. 

Ecommerce sector already have lot of users but if they want to reach the whatsapp audience then they have to have some mechanism which allows users to **buy products without having to type anything.** 

## Solution

Customer can explore products of bussiness, that is given. But if you send an image of a product to the bussiness then bot will be able to find the matching product and will tell customer whether that product is in stock or not. and also will be able to take an order without need to write to bussiness.
